Plan your visit after seeing other's plan. Maintain social distancing. Stay Safe!

Everyone wants to go our during the times when they need to maintain Social Distancing. 

We have plenty of resources, places to see around but need to avoid during these times to protect self and protect others.

What if we plan smartly and plan together so that we are not coming in each others way. This way we can use the resource or visit a place without much worry.

A resource could be a Gym, a shared trail, a shopping mall. 

If we know how many others have same plan for the exact date and time as us, we can shift our time to another time when not many are visiting.
